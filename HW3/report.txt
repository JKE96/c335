Currently it is late at night and I have worked on this program for a while. I will have to go to office hours to fix some of my mistakes because
currently the program is nearly exceeding 75 lines which the instructions says that it is likely wrong if doing so. I have managed to convert the hex
to a binary number and then check what kind of operation will be used on it, but the if statements' conditions are very large because it is checking
each piece of the numbers at a time, which seems to be a problem.
